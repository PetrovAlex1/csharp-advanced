## Problem 4. Car Engine And Tires

Using the Car class, you already created, define another class **Engine**.

The class should have private fields for:

- **horsePower**** : **** int**
- **cubicCapacity**** : ****double**

The class should also have properties for:

- **HorsePower**** : **** int**
- **CubicCapacity**** : ****double**

The class should also have constructor which accepts horsepower and cubicCapacity upon initialization:

Now create class **Tire**.

The class should have private fields for:

- **year**** : **** int**
- **pressure**** : ****double**

The class should also have properties for:

- **Year**** : **** int**
- **Pressure: double**

The class should also have constructor which accepts year and pressure upon initialization:

Finally go to **Car** class and create **private fields for engine and tire array** and **public properties for Engine and Tire array**. Create another constructor which **accepts make, model, year, fuelQuantity, fuelConsumption, Engine** and **Tire** array upon initialization:

You should be able to use the classes like this:
