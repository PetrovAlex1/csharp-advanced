1. Problem 2.Basic Queue Operations

Play around with a queue. You will be given an integer **N** representing the number of elements to enqueue ( **add** ), an integer **S** representing the **number of elements** to **dequeue** ( **remove** ) from the queue and finally an integer **X** , an element that you should look for in the **queue**. If it is, print **true** on the console. If it&#39;s not print the **smallest**** element **currently present in the queue. If there are** no ****elements** in the sequence, print **0** on the console.

### Examples

| **Input** | **Output** | **Comments** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 5 2 321 13 45 32 4 | true   | We have to **enqueue 5** elements. Then we **dequeue**** 2 **of them. Finally, we have to check whether 13 is present in the queue. Since it is we print** true**. |
| 4 1 666666 69 13 420 | 13 |   |
| 3 3 9090 0 90 | 0 |   |
